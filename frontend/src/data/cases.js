    title: 'United States ex rel. Heath v. Wisconsin Bell',
    description: 'A dispute over whether E‑rate reimbursements constitute claims under the False Claims Act.',
    facts:
      'In 1996, Congress created the E‑rate program to help schools and libraries afford telecommunications services. The program provides federal subsidies on a sliding scale, and service providers must follow the “lowest‑corresponding‑price” rule, offering schools and libraries the lowest price charged to similarly situated non‑residential customers. Wisconsin Bell, aware of this rule since its inception, provided services to hundreds of eligible schools and libraries under the E‑rate program. Despite knowing about the rule, Wisconsin Bell did not train its sales representatives or implement compliance mechanisms until 2009. The company admitted to treating pricing contracts for schools and libraries the same as other customers, often instructing sales representatives to offer the highest prices possible. In 2009, following a settlement by its parent company with the Department of Justice and FCC, Wisconsin Bell developed a compliance plan. In 2008, Todd Heath filed a qui tam action under the False Claims Act, alleging that Wisconsin Bell submitted false claims and certifications related to the E‑rate program. After initial dismissal and subsequent appeal, the case proceeded to discovery, and the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Wisconsin Bell. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed and remanded, finding that Heath identified enough specific evidence of discriminatory pricing to allow a reasonable jury to find that Wisconsin Bell, acting with the required scienter, charged specific schools and libraries more than it charged similarly situated customers.',
    legalQuestion:
      'Do reimbursement requests submitted to the Federal Communications Commission\'s E‑rate program qualify as “claims” under the False Claims Act?',
    advocateResponse:
      'Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The False Claims Act, which casts its shadow over every aspect of the administrative state, has always been trained on guarding the public fisc.  The FCA protects government funds by defining a claim as a request for money the government provides or that\'s presented to a government agent.  As a result of political branch choices, E‑rate reimbursement requests check neither box.  The program could have been funded with public money and administered by a government agency, but the political branches chose private funding and a private administrator to prevent E‑rate money from being used to mask budget shortfalls and to avoid the Government Corporation Control Act.  The consequence of those choices is that E‑rate reimbursement requests aren\'t FCA claims.  First, the government doesn\'t provide any money in the E‑rate program.  Text, context, structure, and history all confirm that the government provides money for FCA purposes only if it supplies money from its own funds, putting  the public fisc at risk.  That never happened here.  The government doesn\'t provide money by making one private party pay another private party, and the government doesn\'t provide money by collecting debts owed to a private party and in which the government has no financial stake.  Second, the program\'s private administrator, the Administrative Company, isn\'t a government agent.  By design, it lacks power to bind the government, which in turn lacks control over what matters here:  grants of E‑rate reimbursement requests.  In fact, we know the company can\'t be a government agent because, if it were, it would violate the Government Corporation Control Act.  Choices have consequences, and the choices made by the political branches to insulate the E‑rate program from the public fisc foreclose applying the FCA.  I welcome the Court\'s questions.',
